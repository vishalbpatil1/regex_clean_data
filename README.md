Text preprocessing is one of the most important tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For instance, you may want to remove all punctuation marks from text documents before they can be used for text classification. Similarly, you may want to extract numbers from a text string. Writing manual scripts for such preprocessing tasks requires a lot of effort and is prone to errors. Keeping in view the importance of these preprocessing tasks, the Regular Expressions (aka Regex) have been developed in different languages in order to ease these text preprocessing tasks.

# Conclusion
In this repo we studied some of the most commonly used regex functions in Python. Regular expressions are extremely useful for preprocessing text that can be further used for a variety of applications, such as topic modeling, text classification, sentimental analysis, and text summarization, etc.
